> <i>They say that Data Science is the sexiest job of the 21st Century and rightly so. Data, be it structured or unstructured has power; the power of analytics. The power lies in patterns.</i>

#### How many interactive applications exist that allows you to play with data, for eg. removing outliers visually? How many times have you wished for a simple dashboard that explores the nuances of data? I had some time back. And then I set out to design one. This is a cool slick interactive dashboard that simplifies data science!

### Data

Load a CSV file, look at a summary of rows, columns, feature types and basic stats. Identify features and targets.

### Plots

This is where all the fun begins! Look at univariate, bivariate and multivariate relationships between the features and the target.

### Correlations

Get rid of redundant features using simple plots.

### Impute missing values

Impute missing values by mean / median.

### Remove outliers

Remove outliers if greater than say 5 standard deviations.

### Feature transformations

### Feature engineering

### Machine Learning
